# Tutorial: NFT-minting-tutorial
## Feel free to create issues and PR for the completed solution. 
A tutorial for designing full-stack Non-Fungible Token (NFT) minting application.

## For beginning
- I would recommend you download [VScode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and open termnial to complete below steps.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js ^v16.20.0
- Metamask
- Ganache UI or ganache-cli
- Truffle@latest framework
- InterPlanetary File System / IPFS
- React.js
- Solidity
- OpenZeppelin
- Chai Assertion Library

## Overview
This tutorial will walk you through the process of designing a full-stack Non-Fungible Token (NFT) minting application. The application will allow users to mint NFTs, view their NFTs, and transfer their NFTs to other users. The application will be built using React.js, Solidity, and OpenZeppelin. The application will also use the Chai Assertion Library for testing. The application will be deployed to the Local Ethreum / Rinkeby test network.

```


### Create your first Ethereum Blockchain using Ganache UI or ganache-cli
- Download and install Ganache UI or ganache-cli from https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache
 or just run 
```bash
npm install -g ganache 
```
To check full options of ganache-cli, run 
```bash
ganache-cli --help
```

next, in order to create a local Ethereum Blockchain, run 
```bash
ganache-cli -a 20 -e 1000  -m "test test test test test test test test test test test okay" -i 1337
```

        require(success, "Failed to send Ether");

        emit UserRewarded(user, rewardAmount);
    }

    // This function allows the contract owner to deposit ETH into the contract
    function depositETH() public payable {}

    // This function will allow the owner to withdraw all the remaining ETH.
    function withdrawETH() public onlyOwner {
        uint balance = address(this).balance;
        payable(owner()).transfer(balance);
    }

    // Function to get the total amount of rewards an user received

    }

    // Function to check if a token with a given URI already exists

        return tokenExists[tokenURI];
    }

    // Event emitted when a user is rewarded
    event UserRewarded(address indexed user, uint256 rewardAmount);
}
```
Let me explain line-by-line of the code 
Certainly, let's go line by line:

1. `pragma solidity ^0.8.17;`: This line tells that the source code is written in Solidity language version 0.8.17.

2. The next three lines import external smart contracts from the OpenZeppelin library, which is a framework of reusable and secure smart contracts in the Solidity language.

   - `import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";` imports a standard implementation of an ERC721 token with URI storage.
   
   - `import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";` imports a utility library for safe counter arithmetic.
   
   - `import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";` imports a contract that provides basic authorization control functions. This simplifies the implementation of "user permissions".

3. `contract MyNFT is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {`: This line declares the smart contract named "MyNFT", which inherits from the ERC721URIStorage and Ownable contracts.

4. `using Counters for Counters.Counter;`: This line attaches the Counters library functions to the Counters.Counter struct.

5. `Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;`: Here, _tokenIds is a state variable of type Counter that will keep track of the total number of tokens minted by the contract.

6. `mapping(address => uint256) private rewardsReceived;`: This line declares a state variable `rewardsReceived`, which is a mapping from addresses to integers. It will keep track of the total rewards received by each address.

7. `mapping(address => uint256[]) private userMintedTokens;`: This line declares a state variable `userMintedTokens`, which is a mapping from addresses to arrays of integers. It will keep track of all the tokens minted by each address.

8. `mapping(string => bool) private tokenExists;`: This line declares a state variable `tokenExists`, which is a mapping from strings to booleans. It will help prevent the minting of the same token URI more than once.

9. `constructor() public ERC721("MyNFT", "NFT") {}`: This is the constructor of the contract which is called when the contract is deployed. It calls the constructor of the ERC721 token with a name and a symbol.

10. `mintNFT` is a public function that allows users to mint a new NFT. The function first checks if the tokenURI already exists, increments the tokenIds counter, mints the new token, sets its URI, rewards the user, and keeps track of the newly minted token.

11. `rewardUser` is an internal function that rewards a user with 1 Ether after minting an NFT. It first checks if the contract has enough balance to reward, then sends the Ether and emits a `UserRewarded` event.

12. `depositETH` is a public payable function that allows the owner to deposit Ether into the contract.

13. `withdrawETH` is a public function that allows the owner to withdraw all the Ether from the contract.

14. `totalRewards` is a view function that returns the total rewards received by a user.

15. `getMintedTokens` is a view function that returns all tokens minted by a user.

16. `checkTokenExists` is a view function that checks if a token with a given URI already exists.

17. `event UserRewarded` is an event that gets emitted whenever a user is rewarded.

Meanwhile, if you check in the ganache-cli console, there will  be a transaction crated as : 
```bash
  Transaction: 0x804493fea685ba2270aa45f372150488edc7d1d349c37e8cf25d03156ca20b4d
  Contract created: 0x80d09df430fd965e644ddb8925374f49a73d44e5
  Gas usage: 3191316
  Block Number: 12
  Block Time: Mon Jun 05 2023 18:43:32 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
```

In which: 
- Replacing 'MyNFT': This line indicates that the 'MyNFT' contract is being deployed. If a contract of the same name was already deployed, it's being replaced with this new one.
- Transaction hash: This is the unique identifier of the transaction that was generated when the contract was deployed. 
- The smart contract is deployed to the address `0x17f713aC25039abbfFc34354d3084FC2183b49d5`
- The account `0x8dE930dbAd0D99759Db57C2F906010f87D4185FF` is the owner of the smart contract.  This an important value that you would use to interact with your contract.
- Block number: This is the number of the block in which the contract deployment transaction was included.
- Block timestamp: The timestamp of when the block was mined.
- Account: The address of the account that deployed the contract.
- Balance: The balance of the account that deployed the contract, after the contract was deployed.
- Gas used: This is the total amount of "gas" that was used in the process. In Ethereum, "gas" refers to the computational work required to do a transaction or smart contract operation.
- Gas price: The price you're paying for each unit of gas, in gwei. The total transaction cost is gas used times gas price.
- Value sent: The value sent along with the transaction, in this case, is 0 ETH.
- Total cost: The total cost of the transaction, in ETH.
- Saving artifacts: Artifacts are a way of storing contract abstractions for easy use later. An artifact includes important information about the contract like the contract's deployed address and Application Binary Interface (ABI). The ABI is like a list of methods and variables that you can call on your contract.
- Total deployments: The total number of contract deployments executed in this migration.
- Final cost: The total cost of all contract deployments in this migration.

### test the smart contract
```bash
truffle test
```
The output looks like 
```bash
